                industries. One of the industries that took a major hit is the Music
                industry. Below we will cover some of the main ways this virus has

                        One of the major and immediate impacts that this epidemic has had on
                        the industry is the cancellation of live shows and tours. Musicians
                        everywhere were forced to cancel shows and major music festivals
                        needed to either postpone or cancel their events. Millions and
                        millions of dollars were tossed and millions of people were put out
                        of work due to these circumstances. Venues all over the nation had
                        no other choice but to close their doors and wait out this global
                        pandemic. It is uncertain when shows and performances will take
                        place as normal again. The only thing they can do is wait.

                        With Performances being canceled, artists everywhere have resorted
                        to Live-Stream performances. This is where the artist records
                        themselves preforming from their home or other isolated location.

                        Most musicians rely on shows and ticket sales as their main source
                        of revenue. Yes, they make some money off streaming but it is not
                        substantial enough to be their main source of income. Now that shows
                        are canceled artists have become creative on developing different
                        ways to replace that steady flow of income. Some organizations are
                        paying artists royalty advances and even waiving royalty fees. While
                        some artists are pushing out merchandise lines and videos in order
                        to make up for their devastating losses. This pandemic exposed that
                        streaming income is just a small portion of an artists salary and in
                        fact artists have relied on live shows a lot more than we would
                        expect.

                        4. In addition to show cancelations, clubs and venues all over the
                        country have been shutdown. The nightlife aspect of the music
                        industry has also taken a massive hit due to the pandemic. Nightlife
                        is a huge part of some major cities and without it, thousands of
                        workers are unemployed and customers are left helpless. Venues and
                        the secondary industries that surround them are extremely important
                        when it comes to the promotion of events and music. Club owners who
                        are used to constantly holding events or shows are now forced to
                        completely shut down their businesses with no preparation or
                        expectations for the future.
