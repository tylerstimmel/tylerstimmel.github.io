        <h1>Tyler Stimmel</h1>

        <p class="paragraph"> My name is Tyler Stimmel and I am currently a Sophmore at the University of <br> Miami. I enjoy listening to music, playing sports, and spending time with my family.<br> I am a hard worker that loves to learn through
            experience. I believe the
            best way to do <br> a task is to analyze what has worked for previous people and what has not. I am interested <br> in Music Business and hope to pursue a career within the Music Industry.
